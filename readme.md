## 📌 About KNN

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for:

- 🔹 Classification  
- 🔹 Regression  

It is a lazy learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity (distance) between data points.

Instead of learning a model during training, KNN stores the dataset and performs computation at prediction time.
